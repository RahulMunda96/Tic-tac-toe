I have created a Tic tac toe game using javascript, html , css to test my Learning
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The objective of the game is to get three of your own symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This GitHub repository contains the code for a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Javascript. The main components of the game include:

1. Game Board: The grid where players place their symbols (X or O) during their turns.
2. Player Turns: The game alternates between two players, allowing each player to make a move by choosing an available square on the board.
3. Win Condition: The code checks for winning combinations after each move to determine if there is a winner.
4. Draw Condition: If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. Reset Functionality: After the game ends (either with a win or draw), players have the option to reset the board and start a new round.
